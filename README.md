 You can see this inside my portfolio, click here and you can't miss it! http://neekode.com
 
 Just throw the Background.js and ControllerRenderer.js where you want to store them as components! The background.scss should get you started in terms of styling.
 I'm only using the circle inside the shapesModule, but obviously you can build whatever shapes you want in there.
